# README for Michael Sullivan

## Work

### History

When I started college, both the IBM PC and the Macintosh did not exist but they did when I finished.
UCSB was using
[BSD Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)
(Berkeley also being a UC school) so I have been using the vi(m) editor
for a very long time.

I have been working as a software developer for over 35 years.
My first job after school was as the first hire of a two-person startup.
We wrote custom software for businesses running Unix
([Linus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
was in high school at this time).
Not a lot of work for us but we got by.

A few years later I found myself working at Walt Disney Feature Animation,
helping to make their
[first digitally-produced](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100477/)
(not CGI) movies.
It really was the best job until it wasnâ€™t.
While almost every bit of software Iâ€™ve written is (poof!) gone,
a hundred years after Iâ€™m dead there will be photons from my name
in the credits of [Beauty and the Beast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)
flying around someoneâ€™s living room.
Thatâ€™s pretty cool.

After Disney I rode the original dotcom bubble,
working for a number of fun and stupid companies.
After the bubble burst, it was a succession of meh jobs:
payroll for movies and TV shows,
NBC and ABC,
the company that was hosting my website,
Ticketmaster, Yahoo!,
I wrote a bulk-faxing system to send out confirmations for airlines and hotels,
a printing company,
and on and on...

All that time it was Unix and Linux.
Writing C programs up until the dotcom era, then it was Perl.
Every so often I had to write PHP.
I've gotten into Go in the last couple of years.
Been working with relational databases from the start.
I do mainly backend and tools work.
You want me far away from front-end development.
I have even been a QA engineer and a manager.

I like cloud computing but haven't had much professional experience.
As a developer, I like that I can just use a message queue or a NoSQL database,
rather than having to convince my employer to use one and having to go through
a bake-off to see which we want to standardize on, blah, blah, blah.
Love containers and the whole cloud architecture thing.

Been using agile, mainly scrum, for over ten years.
I was even a scrum master for my dev team at a recent job.
I've used it enough that I know it's not a silver bullet.
I also know that it does give teams tools that they can use to build a process that works just fine for them.

### 18F

#### Lessons Learned

Here are some lessons I have learned while at 18F:

* If someone tells you that person/agency A wants them to do something, go to the source. Get as close as you can to A to find out exactly what they said and want.
* People at 18F are fantastic. That means you will have fantastic people on your projects. People you can rely on. IOW, I learned how to be on a real team again.

### Career goals

My most recent career goal was to manage people.
Managing a team of developers, not managing managers.
I think I am better suited for that.
However, in 18F there are so many interesting opportunities popping up
that I am focused on being useful wherever I am needed.

### Please keep in mind...

I ask that you give me the benefit of the doubt.
I always try to do the right thing so if it seems like I am doing the wrong thing,
know that my intentions are good and honorable.
I respond well to constructive criticism.

If I tell you that I don't understand what you're saying, it's because I actually don't understand what you're saying.
I'm not faking or trying to be a jerk.
I really don't understand so, please, patiently help me understand.

Also, I like chocolate.

### My meeting style

I tend to keep quiet in meetings.
It's not because I'm sleeping.
I am happy to let the discussions go where they will, which is easy to do with smart people in the meeting.
If there is a point that I feel needs to be brought up, I'll bring it up.
I want to *add* to the discussion and not talk just for the sake of talking.

## Non-work

I have four brothers and one sister.
We grew up in towns around Fresno, California, finally settling in [Madera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madera,_California), where my mother still lives.

I have two children, boy/girl twins, who are 22 years old.
My daughter is going to graduate school in the fall on her way to a career in psychology.
She is a *much* better student than her father was.
My son would be happy to talk your ears off about books, movies, and TV shows.

I went to college at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu).
After school I moved to Southern California, following my girlfriend
who was going to graduate school at UCLA (and would become wife #1).
I lived down there until 2019, when my wife (#2) and I moved back to Madera
(my children are still down south).
We did that because I was diagnosed with colon cancer and treatment was
expected to take a year (which it did).
I'm all better now. A little different but all better.

I started doing triathlons in 2009 and, while I have stopped running and
swimming, I am an [avid cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/michaelsullivan).
I'm too big to be a racer but I do like taking long rides.
I hope to take up long-distance touring someday with a dream of
riding across the US.
This year (2021) I finally had room to get my pretty decent weight equipment back
and [took up weight training](http://www.weightsnet.com) again, after a 20 year layoff (kids).
It's fun.

I met wife #2 for the first time at our 30-year high school reunion.
We didn't even *know of* each other before that.
We were quite a topic of conversation at our next reunion.

I enjoy listening to music and watching movies.
There is an actual iPod on my desk connected to speakers.
I enjoy different types of music but, deep down, I am quite the metal-head.ðŸ¤˜
I am overrun with music CDs and look forward to [Bandcamp Fridays](https://isitbandcampfriday.com) each month.
I have a lot of iTunes movies because I don't want to be overrun with Blu-rays.

I enjoy working in the yard and garden.
We're on an acre so there is plenty for me to do.

I even cook.
During my first marriage I made all the meals but now I split the chef duties with my wife.
We make [pretty good meals](https://cookbookfabuloso.blogspot.com), if I do say so myself.
