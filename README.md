# README for Michael Sullivan

## Work

### History

I have been working as a software developer for over 35 years.
My first job after school was as hire #1 of a two-person startup.
We wrote custom software for businesses running Unix
([Linus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
was in high school at this time).
Not a lot of work for us but we got by.
We did create a system for a nationwide network of boat brokers where they could input different search criteria (length, price, etc.) and get
information on boats that matched.
Great web app, right?
Yeah, except this was 1987. It was great but, unfortunately, it was also over ten years ahead of its time.

A few years later I found myself working at [Walt Disney Feature Animation](https://www.disneyanimation.com) (as it was called at the time),
helping to make their
[first digitally-produced](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film)
(not CGI) movies.
It really was the best job until it wasn‚Äôt.
While almost every bit of software I‚Äôve written in my career is (poof!) gone,
a hundred years after I‚Äôm dead there will be photons from my name
in the credits of [Beauty and the Beast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)
flying around someone‚Äôs living room.
That‚Äôs pretty cool.

After Disney I rode the original dotcom bubble,
working for a number of fun and [stupid](https://www.wired.com/1999/02/a-free-pc-gimme/) companies.
After the bubble burst, it was a succession of meh jobs:
payroll for movies and TV shows,
Ticketmaster, Yahoo!,
NBC and ABC,
I wrote a bulk-faxing system to send out confirmations for airlines and hotels,
a printing company,
and on and on...

All that time it was Unix and Linux.
Writing C programs up until the dotcom era, then it was Perl.
Every so often I had to write PHP.
I've gotten into Go in the last couple of years.
Been working with relational databases from the start.
I do mainly backend and tools work.
You want me far away from front-end development.
I have even been a QA engineer and a manager.

I like cloud computing but haven't had much professional experience.
As a developer, I like that I can just use a message queue or a NoSQL database,
rather than having to convince my employer to use one and having to go through
a bake-off to see which we want to standardize on, blah, blah, blah.
Love containers and the whole cloud architecture thing.
In between projects, I am going to try working on [an AWS project](https://github.com/perldude/squarsh)
in [a sandbox](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/launching-software/infrastructure/#cloud-service-provider-csp-sandbox-accounts).
We'll see how that goes.

Been using agile, mainly scrum, for over ten years.
I was even a Certified Scrum Masterüßê for my dev team at a recent job.
I've used it enough to know it's not a silver bullet.
I also know that it does give teams tools that they can use to build a process that works just fine for them.

### 18F

<img src="https://github.com/perldude/perldude/blob/master/my-octocat-1628017257975.png" alt="Octocat" width="35%" align="left">

#### Lessons Learned

Here are some lessons I have learned while at 18F:

* If someone tells you that person/agency A wants them to do something, go to the source. Get as close as you can to A and find out exactly what they want.
* People at 18F are fantastic. That means you will have fantastic people on your projects. People you can rely on. IOW, I learned how to be on a real team again.
* I am a terrible note-taker. Perhaps it is a skill I will develop someday but it's not today. I hear something and then I start thinking about it instead of writing the note. It's bad.
* Maybe I'm not such a terrible note-taker. I tried note-taking where it was a higher-level meeting rather than something more technical (where I would definitely be thinking about what I was hearing) and I was taking notes just fine. Who knows, maybe doing more of this type of note-taking will eventually let me grow into a decent overall note-taker. Someday. Not today.

### Career goals

My most recent career goal was to manage people.
Managing a team of developers, not managing managers.
I think I am better suited for that.
I like the consulting engineer (no coding) thing here at 18F.
Though the more I think about it, I would like to steer towards becoming a supervisor.

#### Soapbox

Not a fan of having managers do non-manager things (like coding).
If you want tech advice from your manager, you better be working at an early-stage startup.
Managers are overhead. Necessary, valuable overhead (the good ones, anyway) but still overhead.
How do you keep that overhead down?
By giving managers as many reports as possible to keep busy *managing them* rather than doing things like coding or architecting.
Between the usual HR stuff, managing career paths, and manager-level work, an organization shouldn't need their managers to do work.
Unless the organization likes overhead.
Which isn't a good sign.

### Please keep in mind...

I ask that you please give me the benefit of the doubt.
I always try to do the right thing so if you feel like I am doing (or saying) the wrong thing,
know that my intentions are good and honorable.
I respond well to constructive criticism.

If I tell you that I don't understand what you're saying, it's because I actually don't understand what you're saying.
I'm not faking or trying to be a jerk.
I really don't understand so, please, patiently help me understand.

Also, I like chocolate.

### My meeting style

I tend to keep quiet in meetings.
It's not because I'm sleeping.
I am happy to let the discussions go where they will, which is easy to do with great people in the meeting.
If there is a point that I feel needs to be brought up, I'll bring it up.
I want to *add* to the discussion and not talk for the sake of talking.

### Missed opportunities

#### Photo sharing

I worked on Woodstock.com during Woodstock 99.
I thought it would be great if concertgoers could share their photos taken at the festival by uploading them to the site.
I wrote the software to do that.
After the festival ended, the "Community Gallery" accounted for more than 50% of the site's traffic.

A smarter person would have recognized that as a clue and gone off to start a photo sharing site. Flickr was still four years away at that point.

#### Local reviews

In early 2001, a co-worker/friend and I were asked by our manager about adding user reviews to Citysearch.com
(user reviews, lead by Amazon, were a fairly new thing at that point).
The team's senior developer/prima donna didn't want to add them because he was certain they would degrade site responsiveness.
We didn't share that opinion so we went ahead and implemented them.
User reviews proved to be *very* popular (and didn't slow down the site at all).
They even got mentioned by the CEO in the next quarterly earnings call.

A smarter person would have recognized that as a clue and gone off with his friend to start a local user reviews site (*especially* after we were laid off).
Yelp was still three years away at that point.

## Non-work

My four brothers, one sister, and I grew up in towns around Fresno, California,
finally settling in [Madera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madera,_California), where my mother and one brother still live.

I have two children, boy/girl twins, who are in their twenties.
My daughter is going to graduate school on her way to a career in psychology.
She is a *much* better student than her father was.
My son would be happy to talk your ears off about books, movies, and TV shows.

Both the IBM PC and the Macintosh did not exist when I started at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu).
They did when I finished.
UCSB was using
[BSD Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)
(Berkeley also being a UC school) so I have been using the vi(m) editor
for a very long time.
After school I moved to Southern California, following my girlfriend
who was going to graduate school at UCLA (and would become wife #1).
I lived down there until 2019, when my wife (#2) and I moved back to Madera
(my children are still down south).
We did that because I was diagnosed with colon cancer and treatment was
expected to take a year (which it did).
I'm all better now. A little different but all better.

I started doing triathlons in 2009 and, while I have stopped running and
swimming, I am now an [avid cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/michaelsullivan).
I'm too big to be a racer but I do like taking long rides.
I hope to take up long-distance touring someday with a dream of
riding solo across the US.
This year (2021) I finally had room to get my pretty decent weight equipment back
and [took up weight training](http://www.weightsnet.com) again, after a 20 year layoff (kids).
It's fun.

Wife #2 and I met for the first time at our 30-year high school reunion.
We didn't even *know of* each other before that.
We were quite a topic of conversation at our next reunion.

Listening to music and watching movies are two of my favorite activities.
There is an actual iPod on my desk connected to speakers.
I enjoy different types of music but, deep down, I am quite the metal-head.ü§ò
I am overrun with music CDs and look forward to [Bandcamp Fridays](https://isitbandcampfriday.com) each month.
I have a lot of iTunes movies because I don't want to be overrun with Blu-rays.
And vinyl just sucks.

Good thing I enjoy working in the yard and garden because
we live on an acre so there is plenty for me to do.

During my first marriage I made all the meals but now I split the chef duties with my wife.
We make [pretty good meals](https://cookbookfabuloso.blogspot.com), if I do say so myself.
