# README for Michael Sullivan

## Who am I?

### Non-work

I have four brothers and one sister.
We grew up in towns around Fresno, California, finally settling in [Madera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madera,_California), where my mother still lives.

I have two children, boy/girl twins, who are 22 years old.
My daughter is going to graduate school in the fall on her way to a career in psychology.
She is a *much* better student than her father was.
My son would be happy to talk your ear off about books, movies, and TV shows.

I went to college at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu).
After school I moved to Southern California, following my girlfriend
who was going to graduate school at UCLA (and would become wife #1).
I lived down there until 2019, when my wife (#2) and I moved back to Madera
(my children are still down south).
We did that because I was diagnosed with colon cancer and treatment was
expected to take a year (which it did).
I'm all better now. A little different but all better.

I started doing triathlons in 2009 and, while I have stopped running and
swimming, I am an [avid cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/michaelsullivan).
I'm too big to be a racer but I do like taking long rides.
I hope to take up long-distance touring someday with a dream of
riding across the US.
This year (2021) I finally had room to get my pretty decent weight equipment back
and [took up weight training](http://www.weightsnet.com) again, after a 20 year layoff (kids).
It's fun.

I met wife #2 for the first time at our 30-year high school reunion.
We didn't even *know of* each other before that.
We were quite a topic of conversation at our next reunion.

I enjoy listening to music and watching movies.
There is an actual iPod on my desk connected to speakers.
I enjoy different types of music but, deep down, I am quite the metal-head.ðŸ¤˜
I am overrun with music CDs and look forward to Bandcamp Fridays each month.
I have a lot of iTunes movies because I don't want to be overrun with Blu-rays.

I enjoy working in the yard and garden.
We're on an acre so there is plenty for me to do.

I even cook.
During my first marriage I made all the meals but now I split the chef duties with my wife.
We make [pretty good meals](https://cookbookfabuloso.blogspot.com), if I do say so myself.

### Work

When I started college, both the IBM PC and the Macintosh did not exist but they did when I finished.
UCSB was using
[BSD Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)
(Berkeley also being a UC school) so I have been using the vi(m) editor
for a very long time.

I have been working as a software engineer for 35 years.
My first job after school was as the first hire of a two-person startup.
We wrote custom software for businesses running Unix
([Linus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)
was in high school at this time).
Not a lot of work for us but we got by.

A few years later I found myself working at Walt Disney Feature Animation,
helping to make their
[first digitally-produced](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100477/)
(not CGI) movies.
It really was the best job until it wasnâ€™t.
While almost every bit of software Iâ€™ve written is (poof!) gone,
a hundred years after Iâ€™m dead there will be photons from my name
in the credits of [Beauty and the Beast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)
flying around someoneâ€™s living room.
Thatâ€™s pretty cool.

After Disney I rode the original dotcom bubble,
working for a number of fun and stupid companies.
After the bubble burst, it was a succession of meh jobs:
payroll for movies and TV shows,
NBC and ABC,
the company that was hosting my website,
Ticketmaster, Yahoo!,
I wrote a bulk-faxing system to send out confirmations for airlines and hotels,
a printing company,
and on and on...

All that time it was Unix and Linux.
Writing C programs up until the dotcom era, then it was Perl.
Every so often I had to write PHP.
I've gotten into Go in the last couple of years.
Been working with relational databases from the start.
I do mainly backend and tools work.
You want me far away from front-end development.
I have even been a QA engineer and a manager.

I like cloud computing, just haven't had much professional experience.
As a developer, I like that I can just use a message queue or a NoSQL database,
rather than having to convince my employer to use one and having to go through
a bake-off to see which we want to standardize on, blah, blah, blah.
Love containers and the whole cloud architecture thing.

Been using agile, mainly scrum, for over ten years.
I was even a scrum master for my dev team at a recent job.
I've used it enough that I know it's not a silver bullet.
I also know that it does give teams tools that they can use to build a process that works just fine for them.

### Trivia

* Iâ€™m in the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838250)
* I have pulled someone out of a burning car
* The farthest I have ridden my bike is [119 miles](https://www.strava.com/activities/1552310223)
* My hair used to be quite a bit longer than it is now
* I've even attended the Academy Awards

## Goals

### Learning goals

Cloud-native architecture.
You know: "This lambda talks to that message queue which tells the application
running in these containers to put something in a database then tell another
message queue to have a notification app send a success message."
All of which does proper logging, is well-monitored, gives great telemetry,
restarts things when they die, and is deployed with CI/CD.
I'd like to learn more about designing that.

### Career goals

Lately, my career goal was to manage people.
Managing a team of developers, not managing managers.
I think I am better suited for that.
However, in 18F there are so many interesting opportunities popping up
all that time that now I am more focused on being useful wherever I am needed.
A new goal will come into focus at some point.

## You can lean on me toâ€¦

If you (or a friend) need to be convinced to get a colonoscopy when your doctor recommends it, I can do that.
I actually have a talk I gave on the whole "journey" through treatment and recovery.

More work-related: I'm a crusty old-timer so I've seen a lot.
If a situation comes up that you don't know how to handle,
maybe I've been there and can offer helpful words.
I'm also helpful for code reviews and offering honest opinions on things.

## How to support me as we work together

Bring donuts and/or chocolate.

## How to support me as a person

I ask that you give me the benefit of the doubt.
I always try to do the right thing so if it seems like I am doing the wrong thing,
know that my intentions are good and honorable.
I respond well to constructive criticism.

## Ways of working together

## Teamwork preferences

At companies that hire well, I find teams just come together.
I suspect that will be the case here at 18F, too.
Just make sure everyone who wants to offer an opinion is able to.

## Technical preferences

* Mac
* iPhone
* vi(m)
* Unix/Linux
* Go
* Perl
* MP3 320 VBR

## Feedback preferences

As long as it is honest and constructive, the medium is irrelevant to me.
Just give it to me in a timely manner.

## Giving feedback on this document

What? You're saying this isn't perfect!? Hmph.
